## Printing

Two ways to print:

1. [M8Q5883SlideMount.3mf](Print/M8Q5883SlideMount.3mf) - A Prusa Slicer project ready to print with the recommended settings below.
2. [M8Q5883SlideMount.stl](Print/M8Q5883SlideMount.stl) - The STL without any parameters (see recommended settings below).

### Recommended settings

For this model PETG is recommend for strength and durability.

I recommend a layer height of 0.15 mm to help with the tiny edges. Use 100% infill since it only takes 17 minutes to print and is mosty solid anyway. Supports are needed under the "lip", otherwise it'll sag. The majority of printers should be able to bridge the 1/2" gap at the connector port, but adding support there is an option.
