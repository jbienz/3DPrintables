## Printing

Two ways to print:

1. [M8Q5883SlideMount.3mf](Print/M8Q5883SlideMount.3mf) - A Prusa Slicer project
   ready to print with the recommended settings below.
2. [M8Q5883SlideMount.stl](Print/M8Q5883SlideMount.stl) - The STL without any
   parameters (see recommended settings below).

### Recommended settings

For this model PETG is recommend for strength and durability.

I recommend a layer height of 0.15 mm to help with the tiny edges. Use 100%
infill since it only takes 17 minutes to print and is mosty solid anyway.
Supports are needed under the "lip", otherwise it'll sag. The majority of
printers should be able to bridge the 1/2" gap at the connector port, but adding
support there is an option.
