## Background

This print is a solid self-snapping mount for the [Mateksys H743 Wing V2](http://www.mateksys.com/?portfolio=h743-wing-v2).

It can be hot glued into foam planes, or it can be screwed into wood planes with a US #4 wood screw or similar.

The top lid securely snaps into the base, but can be separated again with a bit of force. It is designed to remain secure in flight, but not require so much force to open that the base would come unglued. This allows for the Wing V2 to be removed and worked on then returned to the aircraft.

If snapping ever becomes too loose (due to repeated opening and closing), simply reprint the top lid.   


## Design

The Fusion 360 design file is [H743V2SnapMount.f3d](Design/H743V2SnapMount.f3d).

## Printing

Two ways to print:

1. [SnapMount.3mf](Print/SnapMount.3mf) - A Prusa Slicer project ready to print both halves with the recommended settings below.
2. [Bottom.stl](Print/Bottom.stl) and [Top.stl](Print/Top.stl) - The two STL halves without any parameters (see recommended settings below).

### Recommended settings

For this model PLA is not recommend since the snap joints will wear out more quickly. PETG is preferred.

I recommend a layer height of 0.15 mm to help round out the snap joints and 20% infill is sufficient. No supports are necessary.
