## Background

![](Media/Top.png)

I created this because I'm always spilling coffee in my cup holders and they're hard to wash clean! I bought several different options from Amazon and though the designs were OK they, still didn't solve the coffee problem. These 3D printed inserts are water tight, and they can easily be removed and washed out in the sink.

## Design

The Fusion 360 design file is [CupHolders.f3d](Design/CupHolders.f3d). It's fully parametric with many settings you can tweak (using Modify -> Change Parameters). For example, the design could be easily modified to work in a Model X.

| Name | Expression | Comments |
|---------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CupBottomDiameter   | 75 mm | Diameter of exterior bottom of the cup                             |
| CupTopDiameter      | 82 mm | Diameter of exterior top of the cup                                |
| CupHeight           | 60 mm | Total exterior height of the cup holder                            |
| CupCenterFromMiddle | 50 mm | Distance between middle of the bridge and center of either cup     |
| CupWallThickness    | 2 mm  | Thickness of cup walls (protruding inward)                         |
| BridgeBottomWidth   | 33 mm | Width of bridge exterior at the very bottom of cup holder          |
| BridgeTopWidth      | 51 mm | Width of bridge exterior at the very top of cup holder             |
| FiletDiameter       | 1 mm  | Diameter of rounded corners wherever they are used                 |
| BridgeInset         | 4 mm  | Air gaps above and below the bridge                                |
| BasePatternInset    | 15 mm | Distance between outer wall and where inner decorative ring begins |
| PatternThickness    | 1 mm  | Height of any patterns (e.g. logos)                                |


If for some reason the cup holders don't fit in your Model 3 it's probably the `CupCenterFromMiddle` parameter. In my car 50.56mm was too wide but 50mm was quite snug. It could probably be somewhere in between. If you find you need to modify this please let me know what you changed it to.

## Printing

Time Lapse:

Two ways to print:

1. [CupHolders.3mf](Print/CupHolders.3mf) - A Prusa Slicer project ready to print with recommended settings
2. [CupHolders.stl](Print/CupHolders.stl) - Regular STL (see recommended settings below)

I usually print with a layer height of 0.20mm and 10% infill. If you have a 7" bed like the Prusa MINI or MINI+, you'll need to place the part diagonally for it to fit on the plate. The air gap between the two cups is 24.8mm. While many printers can bridge this gap, I recommend painting on a small support to make sure there's no sagging.
