This repository includes various 3D Printable designs that I've created and want to share. I usually include printable STLs as well as the original Fusion 360 files. Whenever possible, I make my Fusion designs parametric for easy modification.

In short, you can print them and modify them freely for personal use. But if you want to use them commercially or sell them for profit, you'll need to contact me for a different license. Please give me credit when you can, and if you make significant changes please share those too.
