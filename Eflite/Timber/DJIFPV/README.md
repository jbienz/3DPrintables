## Background

This print was created to mount the [DJI Digital FPV](https://www.dji.com/fpv) system to E-flite Timber series aircraft ([Timber](https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/timber-1.5m-bnf-basic-as3x-with-floats/EFL5250.html), [Turbo Timber](https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/turbo-timber-evolution-1.5m-bnf-basic-includes-floats/EFL105250.html), [Timber X](https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/timber-x-1.2m-bnf-basic-with-as3x-and-safe-select/EFL38500.html) and [Night Timber](https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/night-timber-x-1.2m-bnf-basic-with-as3x-and-safe-select/EFL13850.html)).

I can't take full credit for this design as it's a combination (and modification) of work from other talented modelers (see below).

The mount is ready to fly after printing, but I recommend adding a bit of Velcro or double-sided sticky tape under the rear of the mount if you plan to fly inverted. The mount shouldn't fall off, but it may bounce when entering or exiting the inversion.


## Design

The Fusion 360 design file is [TimberDJIFPV.f3d](Design/TimberDJIFPV.f3d). Unlike most of my models, this design is not parametric. It's a combination of several models plus additional customization.

This design leverages parts from the following models:

- [DJI Digital FPV Air Unit and Camera mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4082399) by [UltrasoundJelly](https://www.thingiverse.com/ultrasoundjelly/designs)
- [DJI FPV Camera and Transmitter External Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3931186) by [Brett](https://www.thingiverse.com/brett/designs)
- [Air Unit Mount](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=43422775&postcount=3308) by [Flynn203](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=320757)
- [E-Flite Timber 1.5 m FPV Module](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4408089) by [kiefersavoie](https://www.thingiverse.com/kiefersavoie/designs)  

Special thanks to all of those authors for making this design possible.


## Printing

Two ways to print:

1. [TimberDJIFPV-Prusa.3mf](Print/TimberDJIFPV-Prusa.3mf) - A Prusa Slicer project ready to print with recommended settings below
2. [TimberDJIFPV.3mf](Print/TimberDJIFPV.3mf) - Regular 3MF without any parameters (see recommended settings below)

### Recommended settings

For this model PLA is **NOT recommend** for the following reasons:

- PLA can be brittle
- PLA has relatively low tensile strength compared to other materials
- PLA does not weather well in the sun 

Therefore, PETG is recommended. Nylon materials like Alloy 910 are also an option, but nylon supports are notoriously difficult to remove and this model does require several supports.

I recommend a layer height of 0.2 mm and 30% infill. Printing with the antenna supports on the base will require the fewest supports. The large holes that can be used to secure the air unit do not require supports, but I do recommend using supports for the crescent moon shaped hole on the camera mount.

Here are two photos of the recommended print configuration:
